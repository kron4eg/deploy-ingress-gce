# ingress-gce

[![reuse compliant](https://reuse.software/badge/reuse-compliant.svg)](https://reuse.software/)

This repository is dedicated to building [kubernetes/ingress-gce](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-gce) images for Gardener project.

## Building a new Release

Once in a while a new release of the
[kubernetes/ingress-gce](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-gce) will be
released and we need to build new docker image. In order to trigger the new
release one can use two options, tigger the release workflow from the web UI or
from CLI, see more at the
https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow.


### Trigger the release from the Github web UI

* Navigate to Actions https://github.com/gardener/ingress-gce/actions
* Select **Build, push and release** worflow
* Click **Run worflow** button
* Input `New release tag to publish` and `kubernetes/ingress-gce version to build`
* Click green **Run worflow** button

### Trigger the release from gh CLI

```shell
gh workflow run release.yaml -f release_tag=<NEW_TAG_TO_RELEASE> -f ingress_gce_version=<TAG_FROM_UPSTREAM>
```

Where `NEW_TAG_TO_RELEASE` is a new tag for the GH release and image to be
created and `TAG_FROM_UPSTREAM` is existing target tag to build from
[kubernetes/ingress-gce](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-gce).

Example:

```shell
gh workflow run release.yaml -f release_tag=v1.30.0-sap.0 -f ingress_gce_version=v1.30.0
```

Will build [kubernetes/ingress-gce](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-gce) binary from v1.30.0 git tag, and publish docker image: `ghcr.io/gardener/ingress-gce:v1.30.0-sap.0`


## How to use this repository template

This template repository can be used to seed new git repositories in the gardener github organisation.

- [Create the new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
  based on this template repository
- Replacing placeholders:
  - In file `.reuse/dep5` replace placeholder `<repo name>` with the name of your new repository.
  - In file `CODEOWNERS` replace `<repo name>` and `<maintainer team>`. Use the name of the github team in [gardener teams](https://github.com/orgs/gardener/teams) defining maintainers of the new repository.
- Set the repository description in the "About" section of your repository
- Describe the new component in additional sections in this `README.md`
- Ask the [Owner of the gardener github organisation](https://github.com/orgs/gardener/people?query=role%3Aowner)
  - to double-check the initial content of this repository
  - to create the maintainer team for this new repository
  - to make this repository public
  - protect at least the master branch requiring mandatory code review by the maintainers defined in CODEOWNERS
  - grant admin permission to the maintainers team of the new repository defined in CODEOWNERS
